# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.😃

Technologies Used

* HTML: Structure of the game board and interface.📄

* CSS: Styling for the board and animations.🎨
